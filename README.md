# 🪑Univariate-Time-Series-Forecasting
Designed and implemented a time series forecasting project on 11 years of monthly sales data from a furniture store. The project involved data preprocessing, trend and seasonality analysis, and model development using ARIMA and SARIMA.

# 📝Project Overview:
  To develop a time series forecasting model using 11 years of monthly furniture store sales data to accurately predict future sales trends and support data-driven business decisions.
  
  **Objective**:
- Analyze 11 years of monthly furniture store sales data.
- Identify **trends**, **seasonality** in the sales data.
- Build and evaluate forecasting models (ARIMA, SARIMA)
- 
## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**:U.S. Census Bureau website 
- **Records**: 11 years of monthly sales (132 observations)
- **Features**: Month, Year, Sales
- **Format**: CSV/Exce

## 🛠 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Import CSV file and parse dates  
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Plot sales over time  
   - Time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, residuals)  
3. **Model Building**  
   - ARIMA  
   - SARIMA
4. **Model Evaluation**    
   - Compare model accuracy     
5. **Forecasting & Visualization**  
   - Plot predicted vs actual sales  
   - Create forecast for next 12–24 months
